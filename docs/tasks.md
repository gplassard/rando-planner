# Rando Planner Implementation Tasks

This document contains a detailed checklist of tasks to implement the improvements outlined in the plan.md document. Tasks are organized by theme and ordered by implementation priority.

## 1. Data Management and Integration

### 1.1 Hiking Route Data Integration
- [x] Create a `useRandoRoutes` hook to load and manage hiking route data
- [x] Enhance data models to represent relationships between stations and routes
- [x] Implement filtering to show only relevant routes based on selected stations
- [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for hiking route data structures

### 1.2 Data Preprocessing Optimization
- [x] Enhance data preparation scripts for more efficient data structures
- [x] Add preprocessing to establish connections between stations and routes
- [x] Create spatial indices to improve performance when searching for nearby routes
- [x] Optimize the data loading process for faster application startup

## 2. User Interface Enhancements

### 2.1 Map Visualization Improvements
- [x] Display hiking routes on the map as lines connecting stations
- [x] Implement different colors/styles for selected routes vs. available routes
- [x] Add visual indicators for start, end, and intermediate points
- [x] Implement zooming to show the entire selected route
- [x] Add tooltips showing route information on hover

### 2.2 Sidebar Redesign
- [x] Redesign the sidebar to show a structured itinerary with clear sections
- [x] Display human-readable information instead of raw JSON
- [x] Add summary statistics (total distance, number of legs, estimated time)
- [x] Implement collapsible sections for detailed information
- [x] Create a print-friendly view of the itinerary

### 2.3 Interactive Route Selection
- [x] Implement a route selection interface when users select start and end points
- [x] Show alternative routes between points when available
- [x] Allow users to drag routes to modify the path
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs for major itinerary changes

## 3. Core Functionality Implementation

### 3.1 Leg Management
- [x] Extend the Itinerary model to include the concept of legs between points
- [x] Implement different types of legs (hiking, rest)
- [x] Add UI controls to add, remove, and modify legs
- [x] Store additional metadata for each leg (distance, estimated time, difficulty)
- [x] Implement validation to ensure a coherent itinerary

### 3.2 Distance and Time Calculation
- [x] Implement algorithms to calculate distances along hiking routes
- [x] Add estimated time calculations based on distance and terrain
- [x] Display distance and time information for each leg
- [x] Calculate and display total trip statistics
- [ ] Add elevation profile visualization for routes

### 3.3 Rest Leg Implementation
- [x] Add UI controls to insert rest days at specific locations
- [x] Extend the itinerary model to include rest days
- [x] Update the trip summary to account for rest days
- [x] Allow users to add notes to rest days (accommodation, points of interest)

## 4. Technical Improvements

### 4.1 State Management Refactoring
- [ ] Evaluate and implement a more robust state management solution
- [ ] Refactor existing hooks to better separate concerns
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] Add persistence for user's itineraries (local storage)

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading of route data
- [ ] Add clustering for stations when zoomed out
- [ ] Optimize rendering of routes on the map
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations

### 4.3 Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for key user flows
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
- [ ] Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
- [ ] Create a test plan document with test cases

## 5. Documentation and Deployment

- [ ] Update README with new features and usage instructions
- [ ] Create user documentation with examples
- [ ] Document the API and data structures
- [ ] Set up automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create a demo/tutorial for new users
