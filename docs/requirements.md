The rando planner App should allow user to plan for their hiking trips

The hiking trips are over several days and go from town to town.
Rando planner also integrates with train station data in order to be able to find good starting and ending locations.

When planning a hiking trip user will
* Select a starting location in a town with a train station
* Select an ending location in another town with a train station
* Construct a path from start to end through hiking routes
* Add legs to rest
* Have a summary of the trip with start location, end locations, number of legs, total distance and detailed distance for each leg
